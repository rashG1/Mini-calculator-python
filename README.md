Advanced Calculator

This is an advanced calculator built using Python and the Tkinter library. It supports basic arithmetic operations along with advanced features like memory storage, recall, square root calculation, and more. The calculator offers an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for performing mathematical calculations.

Features

Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Square Root: Calculate the square root of a number.

Power and Modulus: Perform exponentiation and modulus operations.


Memory Functions:

Memory Store (M+): Add the current value to memory.

Memory Subtract (M-): Subtract the current value from memory.

Memory Recall (MR): Recall the stored value from memory.

Memory Clear (MC): Clear the stored memory.

Clear Function: Clear the current expression.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid operations (e.g., division by zero) with an error message.
