Advanced Calculator
This is an advanced calculator built using Python and the Tkinter library. The calculator has basic arithmetic functionality along with advanced features like memory storage, recall, square root, and more. It offers a simple and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for performing mathematical calculations.

Features
Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Square Root: Calculate the square root of a number.
Power and Modulus: Includes exponentiation and modulus operations.
Memory Functions:
Memory Store (M+): Add the current value to memory.
Memory Subtract (M-): Subtract the current value from memory.
Memory Recall (MR): Recall the stored value from memory.
Memory Clear (MC): Clear the stored memory.
Clear Function: Clear the current expression.
Error Handling: Handles invalid operations (e.g., division by zero) gracefully with an error message.
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code

Install Python Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from Python's official website.

Run the Application To start the calculator, simply run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python calculator.py
How to Use
Enter numbers and operations using the buttons on the interface.
Use the = button to evaluate the expression.
Memory options:
Use M+ to store a value in memory.
Use M- to subtract a value from memory.
Use MR to recall the stored memory value.
Use MC to clear the memory.
Use the sqrt button for square root calculations.
Use the C button to clear the current expression.
